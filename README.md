# Social-Network-Analysis
SNA on various social graphs including bitcoin trading networks &amp; Facebook friendship connections and Other.

I've been through the literatur of Social Networks Analysis.

I used several SNA methods, metrics, coefficients, algorithms to analyse communities, clusters, popularity, influence, connectivity and other caratacteristics of the networks. 

I used some Machine Learning algorithms to find clusters and forecast connections in the networks.

I generated some graphs to modelise some influence aspects on social graphs.
